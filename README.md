AcadMate is a browser-based productivity dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed specifically for university students, the application integrates essential academic tools and resources 
into a single user-friendly platform. This project was developed as part of an academic requirement and aims to enhance student productivity by providing seamless access to study utilities, university portals, 
and a distraction-free workspace.

Note Taking Module: A simple note pad for jotting down tasks, thoughts, or to-do lists within the application.
WebView Integration: Allows students to open university-related portals (ERP, LMS, Academics) within the application using an embedded iframe.
Dark Mode Toggle: Includes a built-in dark mode toggle with persistent theme storage for better user comfort.
Minimal UI/UX: Clean, responsive layout optimized for productivity and low visual clutter.
